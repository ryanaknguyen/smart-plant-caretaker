# University of Washington Embedded Systems Capstone Project (Winter 2024) - Smart Plant Caretaker

This repository serves as the reference for our code and documents that our team (Ryan Nguyen, Henry Do, Archie Deng, Nathan Lee, and David Luo) created to guide our design and implementation of our Smart Plant Caretaker. Our capstone project, supervised by Professor Rania Hussein, utilizes the following specifications:

- Is a consumer product
- The system interacts and responds to the environment in real-time
- Uses the Raspberry Pi and STM32F4 boards
- Aligns with the ABET Expectations for a senior project, one with a substantial design

This repo was originally stored on Google Drive, but moved to Github for better visibility and safekeeping.
